# SW_wk2_P2

#### By **Stuart Wood** 

## Other Contributers 
I did not contribute with any other students on the content of my portfolio. I used the Week_02_Activities to refresh my mind on how to format and style the css.

## Description
Built a personal proffesional portfolio, with a short bio, and links to future projects that will be completed. I included a Contact me section, and active links to show my work history and my live applications.
The portfolio is not complete, but can be added on to during the duration of this bootcamp as my skills as a developer progress.
